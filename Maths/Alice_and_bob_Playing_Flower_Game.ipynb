    "The game proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice takes the first turn.\n",
    "- In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lane and pick one flower from that side.\n",
    "- At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.\n",
    "- Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:\n",
    "- Alice must win the game according to the described rules.\n",
    "- The number of flowers x in the first lane must be in the range [1,n].\n",
